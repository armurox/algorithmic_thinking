This is a repository that contains my solutions to problems contained in the book "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingardo. The aim of the book is to teach new data structures and techniques using competitive programming problems. These solutions are my own, and are intended to demonstrate my thinking before learning the solution available in the book. Each problem will be solved in C, as that is the intended language in the book. Occassionally, variants of the solutions in JavaScript, Python and C++ may be seen as well.
